# Dye & Durham Coding Assessment 
The Dye & Durham coding assessment is just that, an assessment. The problem domain is deliberately simple, and you could very easily write an extremely terse solution that satisfies the requirement. But our goal is not to see you implement a trivial sorting algorithm. Most importantly it is to understand how your code communicates its purpose clearly and with empathy to your potential team members. What do we mean by empathy? Empathy here is caring about how easy your code is to understand and navigate for the next engineer who touches it. Secondly it is to understand your ability to compose quality code that adheres to SOLID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles. Thirdly, to see how you write tests. 

Implement the solution as a console app using .NETCore. 

So, give us your best effort, a solution that you are proud of. 

# The Goal: Name Sorter 
Build a name sorter. Given a set of names, order that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A name must have at least 1 given name and may have up to 3 given names. 

# Example Usage 
Given a a file called unsorted-names-list.txt containing the following list of names; 

    Janet Parsons 
    Vaughn Lewis 
    Adonis Julius Archer 
    Shelby Nathan Yoder 
    Marin Alvarez 
    London Lindsey 
    Beau Tristan Bentley 
    Leo Gardner 
    Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke 
    Mikayla Lopez 
    Frankie Conner Ritter 
    
Executing the program in the following way; 

    name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt 
    
Should result the sorted names to screen;

    Marin Alvarez 
    Adonis Julius Archer 
    Beau Tristan Bentley 
    Hunter Uriah Mathew Clarke 
    Leo Gardner 
    Vaughn Lewis 
    London Lindsey 
    Mikayla Lopez 
    Janet Parsons 
    Frankie Conner Ritter 
    Shelby Nathan Yoder 
    
and a file in the working directory called sorted-names-list.txt containing the sorted names. 

# Assessment Criteria 

We will execute your submission against a list with a thousand names. 

# Your submission must meet the following criteria. 
 * The solution should be available for review on github. 
 * The names should be sorted correctly. 
 * It should print the sorted list of names to screen. 
 * It should write/overwrite the sorted list of names to a file called sorted-names-list.txt. 
 * Unit tests should exist. 
 * Minimal, practical documentation should exist. 
 
# Awesome, but not essential criteria 
Create a build pipeline like Travis or AppVeyor that execute build and test steps.
# Submission 
When you are done let us know the url of the repo.

# Solution overview

This is a solution for sorting out a list of names by last name. .Net core framework and c# was used for implementing the project. And also used SOLID principles and fluent interfaces for compose the code quality.

# Build to Run
In the command prompt, first set the directory to your project folder and then type: 

    >dotnet build
    
to run the project type:

    >dotnet run ./unsorted-names-list.txt
    
# Test
  * Note: Please make sure you have run the build script before you run the test script.
